## Description

The progressive budget tracker allows a user to create transactions (withdrawals and deposits) that can be tracked either online or offline. The offline transactions are stored in an indexed db database, and once the user is back online, the transactions are added to the total. Online transactions are stored in a Mongo DB cloud database.

The user can download this application on their desktop through a web manifest. There is an option to download the app in the top right corner of the browser right next to the bookmarks icon in Google Chrome.
